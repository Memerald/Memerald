## My process

Structuring the HTML was the first thing I did when I started this project and after the entire barebones of the project was laid out is when I started styling the 3 cards as per the specs. I feel it is important to do it this way so that you don't have to keep shifting between doing HTML and CSS and can focus on one thing at a time which only increases efficiency which is exactly what I noticed when I first started learning HTML CSS versus how I practice now.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### Continued development

I am focusing more on creating responsive sites.
